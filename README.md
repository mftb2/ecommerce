# Overview

As a software engineer I created a program that can analyze the information and data in a csv file, specifically one related to ecommerce sales.

The data I chose to analyze in question includes the order id, product name, quantity, price, and date.  I ended up just writing my own csv file after having multiple issues with panda and anaconda.

My purpose in writing this software is to condense and present sales data in a clear an manageable way so as to view the total sales overall, the sales total per product, identify the best-selling product, and show the total quantity sold.

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

My questions regarding the csv file that our program answers include how much revenue did we generate in sales per product, what is our best selling product, and how many products have we sold in total.

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}

# Development Environment

In the beginning I planned on using pandas and anaconda to develop my program.  However, after multiple roadblocks and difficulties, I decided to stick to what I know and create my program using python.

I'm actually fairly happy with how everything turned out using just python.  Down the road, I might be interested in taking more time or working through the nitty gritty of learning pandas and anaconda, or having someone who knows what they're doing teach me, but for now, my program does what I want it to do.
